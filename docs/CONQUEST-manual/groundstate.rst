Finding the ground state
========================

Finding the electronic ground state is the heart of any DFT code.  In
CONQUEST, we need to consider: the density matrix (found using
diagonalisation or linear scaling); self-consistency; and the support
functions (which can be optimised or not).

Full details of how the support functions are found and represented
can be found in **add this link**.
