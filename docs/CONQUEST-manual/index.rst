CONQUEST: a local orbital, large-scale DFT code
===============================================

CONQUEST is a massively parallel DFT code, using a local orbital basis
to represent the Kohn-Sham eigenstates.  The code can operate in full
diagonalisation mode or linear scaling, with a variety of basis sets.
