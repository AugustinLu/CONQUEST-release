Electronic Structure
====================

CONQUEST can be used to produce a wide variety of information on the electronic
structure of different systems, including: density of states (DOS) and atom-projected
DOS (or pDOS); band-resolved charge density; band structure; and electronic
polarisation.  Many of these are produced with the :ref:`post-processing <post-proc>`
code.  All of these (at present) require the exact diagonalisation approach to the
ground state; linear scaling solutions are not possible.

.. _es_conv:

Converged charge density
------------------------

In most cases (except :ref:`polarisation <es_pol>`) the data required is produced
by a non-self-consistent calculation which reads in a well-converged charge density.
The convergence is mainly with respect to :ref:`Brillouin zone sampling <gs_diag_bz>`,
but also self-consistency (a tight tolerance should be used).  The basic procedure
is:

  1. Perform a well-converged calculation, writing out charge density (ensure that
     the Brillouin zone is well sampled, the SCF tolerance is tight (``minE.SCTolerance``)
     and that the flag ``IO.DumpChargeDensity T`` is set)
  2. Perform a non-self-consistent calculation for the quantity desired
     (set ``minE.SelfConsistent F`` and ``General.LoadRho T`` to read and fix the charge density)
  3. Run the appropriate :ref:`post-processing <post-proc>` to generate the data

However, note that the charge density often converges much faster with respect to
Brillouin zone sampling than the detailed electronic structure, so the use of a
non-self-consistent calculation is more efficient.

.. _es_dos:

Density of states
-----------------

The total density of states (DOS) is generated from the file ``eigenvalues.dat`` which is
written by all diagonalisation calculations.  See :ref:`density of states <pp_DOS>` for
details on parameters which can be set.

The atom-projected DOS requires the wave-function coefficients which will be generated
by setting ``IO.write_proj_DOS T``; further analysis is performed in :ref:`post-processing <pp_pDOS>`.

.. _es_band_struc:

Band structure
--------------

The band structure along a series of lines can be generated.
See :ref:`post-processing <post-proc>` for more details.

.. _es_band_dens:

Band-resolved densities
-----------------------

A band-resolved density is the quantity :math:`\mid \psi_n(\mathbf{r}) \mid^2`
for the :math:`n^{\mathrm{th}}` Kohn-Sham eigenstate (we plot density because
the eigenstates are in general complex).  It requires wavefunction coefficients
which are generated by setting ``IO.outputWF T``.  Full details are found in
the :ref:`band density <pp_band_dens>` section of the :ref:`post-processing <post-proc>`
part of the manual.

.. _es_pol:

Electronic Polarisation
-----------------------

The electronic polarisation (the response of a material to an
external electric field) can be calculated using the approach
of Resta :cite:`es-Resta:1992aa` by setting the tag ``General.CalcPol T``.
The direction in which polarisation is found is set using the tag
``General.PolDir`` (choosing 1-3 gives x, y or z, respectively, while
choosing 0 gives all three directions, though this is normally not
recommended).

The Resta approach is a version of the modern theory of polarisation (MTP)
(perhaps better known in the method of King-Smith and Vanderbilt :cite:`es-KingSmith:1993aa`)
where the polarisation is found as:

.. math::
   \mathbf{P} = -\frac{e\mathrm{L}}{\pi V}\mathrm{Im}\mathrm{ln}\mathrm{det}\mathbf{S}\\
   \mathrm{S}_{mn} = \langle \psi_{m} \vert \exp{i2\pi \mathbf{r}}/L\vert\psi_{n} \rangle

where :math:`\mathrm{L}` is a simulation cell length along an appropriate direction
and :math:`V` is the simulation cell volume.  This approach is only valid in the large
simulation cell limit, with Gamma point sampling.

As with all calculations in the MTP,
the only valid physical quantity is a *change* of polarisation between two configurations.
A very common quantity to calculate is the Born effective charge (BEC), which is defined
as :math:`Z^{*}_{\alpha\beta}V\partial P_{\alpha}/\partial u_\alpha` and is most easily
calculated by finding the change in polarisation as one atom (or one sublattice) is
moved a small amount.
