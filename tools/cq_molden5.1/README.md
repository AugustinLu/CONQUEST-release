# How to use [Molden5.1](http://cheminf.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/) for editing Conquest inputs
This tool is to help Conquest users which want to:
- generate from scratch molecular stuctures
- edit xyz, pdb, cif... molecular/crystal structures 
- convert/check without pain the format

Typical application is for building DNA sequence (in a box) and save it directly into Conquest input format.

Remarks:
- this is not intended to handle millions of atoms
- this is more to help you for input easy edit (without scripts ;-)
- help for fast vizual inspection that the structure provided to the CQ code is correct!

Edit the makefile (no configure file) in src/ and compile, then:
**molden** or **gmolden** (activate OpenGL)

## Examples
### From pdb file
### From cif file
